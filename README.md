# LangChain
The success of ChatGPT and GPT-4 have shown how large language models trained with reinforcement can result in scalable and powerful NLP applications. 
However, the usefulness of the response depends on the prompt, which led to users exploring the prompt engineering space. In addition, most real-world NLP use cases need more sophistication than a single ChatGPT session. And here’s where a library like LangChain can help!
LangChain is a Python library that helps you leverage large language models to build custom NLP applications.
In this guide, we’ll explore what LangChain is and what you can build with it. We’ll also get our feet wet by building a simple question-answering app with LangChain.
